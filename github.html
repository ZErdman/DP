            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>It’s almost a no-brainer to use Git and Github just because of their dominance in today’s programming scene. Even though we need about 5% of their features, we can still benefit from the way Git and Github makes tracking and sharing files so effortless by eliminating the drudge work</p>

<p>For us, Git and Github are just a much better way to post work online and easily make changes and improvements to it. It’s far more sane, safe, and efficient than making duplicate backup folders/USB and sending each other email attachments.</p>

<p>In this guide, I go through the steps on how to set up a Git repository on our own computers and then sync it to Github. I specifically focus on using the command-line because the Github Desktop Client isn’t much of an advantage for our work. As long as you think of a Git repository as just being a fancy file folder, you’ll know all you need to know to use Git and Github well for this class.</p>

<h1 id="need-a-quick-reference">Need a quick reference?</h1>

<p>Have you already read this laborious tutorial and you just need to get a refresher on commands? Here are the few things that we need to know – but please read on for <a href="#major-caveats">some major caveats</a> about the very narrow, simple-minded way that we use Git and Github.</p>

<h2 id="i-just-want-to-make-some-changes-and-push-those-changes-to-my-github-repo">I just want to make some changes and push those changes to my Github repo</h2>

<p>Here's the pattern: <code>add</code>, then <code>commit</code>, then <code>push</code></p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c"># Just add every change that is currently untracked in the repo</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git add --all   
<span class="c"># Make those changes part of the repo, no matter how boring</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s1">'whatev'</span>  
<span class="c"># Just push those changes to the "origin"</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git push
<span class="c"># IF you're asked about specifying a default branch, do:</span>
<span class="c"># git push -u origin master</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And occasionally check your repo as it lives on Github to make sure it has what you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-new-git-repository-from-one-of-your-computers-existing-file-folders">How to create a new Git repository from one of your computer's existing file folders?</h2>

<p>I'll pretend you have a folder named <code>foobar</code> located at this path: <code>/Users/thatsme/Downloads/foobar</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to that directory so that you can run commands via the shell. The easiest way is to just pop open Terminal and <code>cd</code> into it:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> $ cd /Users/thatsme/Downloads/foobar
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you're in the folder that you want to turn into a repo (run the <code>pwd</code> commmand to make sure), then run:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> $ git init
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You should receive a response of:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/thatsme/Downloads/foobar/.git/
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>git init</code> basically means creating that hidden <code>.git</code> subfolder, which you should never have to inspect manually.</p>

<h2 id="i-forgot-the-state-of-my-git-repo">I forgot the state of my Git repo</h2>

<p>Nothing wrong with using the <code>git status</code> command just for the fun of it. Even if you do it in a directory that <em>is not</em> a git repository, you just get this message:</p>

<p><code>
$ git status
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
</code></p>

<p>It just means, <em>"Hey, there's no .git/ directory in the current directory"</em></p>

<p>If you run <code>git status</code> in an actual git repository, you'll get information on whether any changes have been made that aren't yet tracked (i.e. need to be added). Or, if there are tracked changes that need to be committed.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-add-changes-to-a-single-file-to-be-tracked">How do I add changes to a single file to be tracked?</h3>

<p><code>
$ git add somefile.txt
</code></p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-just-add-all-changes-that-could-possibly-have-been-made">How do I just add all changes that could possibly have been made?</h3>

<p><code>
$ git add --all
</code></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-delete-a-file-from-the-repository">How do I delete a file from the repository?</h2>

<p>This is a tough question. Is the file in question a file that you no longer need, ever? Then just delete it, and use <code>git add</code> – remember that <code>add</code> refers to <em>adding</em> changes of all types, including deletions:</p>

<p><code>
$ git add somedeadfile.txt
</code></p>

<p>When you then make a <code>git commit</code> action, the file will be noted as <strong>deleted</strong></p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s1">'bye file'</span>
<span class="o">[</span>master 997a697] bye file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions<span class="o">(</span>+<span class="o">)</span>, 0 deletions<span class="o">(</span>-<span class="o">)</span>
 delete mode 100644 somedeadfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>What if it's a file that you accidentally added – but you haven't yet committed? Or that you've committed (and/or pushed), but you want wiped out from the history of the repo? If you're in my class, <strong>just email me as soon as possible</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="major-caveats">Major caveats</h2>

<p>The brief lessons and tips in this guide assume you aren't doing anything beyond using Github in a very predictable, personable fashion that is barely removed from just making changes to a file folder:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are the sole contributor to the repo.</li>
  <li>You want to make new branches and compartmentalize your work, rather that constantly changing the "master" version of the repo.</li>
  <li>You aren't doing making/pushing changes via your personal computer <em>and</em> via the Github interface.</li>
  <li>There are only two copies of the repo: on your computer and on Github, respectively.</li>
  <li>You aren't planning to revert changes in any complicated way.</li>
  <li>You aren't using any of Github's special social features, such as "forking" and making/accepting "pull requests"</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I don't <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/">get into the fun of <strong>merge conflicts</strong></a>, the kind of thing that happens naturally when more than one person is changing things in a repo. It's usually no big deal. But I'll deal with those in another guide.</p>

<h1 id="a-bit-about-git-and-github">A bit about Git and Github</h1>

<p>Some ramblings about Git and Github. I'll have better metaphors and analogies at some point.</p>

<h2 id="git-a-fancy-way-of-keeping-track-of-files-in-a-folder">Git: A fancy way of keeping track of files in a folder</h2>

<p>It's easy to conflate Git and Github, but there is a difference: Git is software that efficiently keeps track of every change to a file that you want to keep track of. This is its <strong>version control</strong> functionality – instead of creating endless, manual backups of an important file – e.g. <code>THESIS-ALMOST-FINAL.DOC</code>, <code>THESIS-MORE-FINAL.DOC</code>, <code>BACKUP-THESIS-BEFORE-MAKING-IT-MORE-FINAL.doc</code> – the Git program – on command – will note the content and exact timestamp of changes that have made between <em>commits</em> of a file/file directory. Reverting back is painless.</p>

<h2 id="github-a-place-to-share-your-git-repositories">Github: A place to share your Git repositories</h2>

<p>One of Git's strongest selling points is its distributed nature: multiple people can have clones of the same Git repository and, more or less, make additions, changes, deletions in a very ordered fashion. <strong>Github.com</strong> takes advantage of Git's features and provides a convenient place to host Git repositories.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-so-many-roads-to-using-git-and-github">Why are there so many roads to using Git and Github?</h2>

<p>The nuances between just using <strong>Git</strong> and/or using Git with Github aren't particularly important to us. But the fact that they are two different things means that these two things should not be a surprise to us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It's possible to have Git installed on your computer and to use it without ever logging on to Github, just like it's possible to have friends without going on to Facebook.</li>
  <li>It's possible to create a Github account without having Git properly installed on your computer, just like you can sign up for Facebook without having any friends.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="do-you-have-git-installed-on-your-computer">Do you have Git installed on your computer?</h3>

<p>This is probably the most nebulous thing for me. I have my computer set up with the tools and conveniences common to professional developers. I don't think I can remember when I actually installed <strong>Git</strong> – it's just there, and it just works.</p>

<p>However, if you're new to development, then installing Git was likely never a priority. Maybe your system is new enough that it comes with Git. Or maybe it's old enough that the incantations on my system won't work on yours. In any case, here's an easy way to see if Git is even installed.</p>

<p>Go to your system's command line, then run the following command:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git --version
</code></pre>

<p>(don't include the <code>$</code> – I use that to indicate that the command is to be run at the shell, whether you're on OSX/Linux or Windows)</p>

<p>Hopefully the output of that command will look similar to this (i.e. your system's Git is version 2.x or better, in the year 2016):</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git version 2.6.4
</code></pre>

<h1 id="lets-get-started">Let's get started</h1>

<p>One of the charms of Git and its distributed mindset – that a repository can start from anywhere, and then be cloned and contributed to by anyone across the world – can be confusing when you first start. Because it means that there are several starting points to get to the same destination.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this guide, I will assume:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have your own computer</li>
  <li>On this computer, you have a file folder named <code>compciv-2016</code> that you wish to turn into a Github repository</li>
  <li>
    <p>And while it doesn't matter exactly where <code>compciv-2016/</code> exists in your folder structure, let's just assume that it is on your <strong>Desktop</strong>, i.e. for OS X:</p>

    <p>Users/
     |__ your_username_on_ur_computer/
        |<strong>_ Desktop/
            |</strong>___ compciv-2016/</p>
  </li>
  <li>You should also by now have created a Github account. If your username is "some_name", then your Github homepage is: https://github.com/some_name</li>
  <li>You eventually want to connect your local Git repository, i.e. <code>~/Desktop/compciv-2016</code> with a repository created on Github, i.e. at <code>https://github.com/some_name/compciv-2016</code></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we'll start with the Git only steps, then move to Github.</p>

<h1 id="turning-a-file-folder-into-a-git-repository">Turning a file folder into a Git repository</h1>

<p>For our purposes, we can think of a <strong>Git repository</strong> as just a file folder with special powers, including an efficient, seamless process for tracking every change we ever make to that folder.</p>

<p>Let's be clear on this: the first step of turning a file folder into a git repository has <em>nothing to do with Github</em>. Git is software that any computer can use. Github is a web service. We can do things with Git without being logged into Github or even onto the Internet.</p>

<p>OK, onwards with just <strong>Git</strong>:</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-git-repository">Creating a Git repository</h2>

<p>First, open the <strong>Terminal</strong> and change into the target directory, i.e. the file folder that we intend to turn into a Git repository. Assuming it is <code>~/Desktop/compciv-2016</code> and you're on an OSX/Linux system, here's how to change into that directory:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop/compciv-2016
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is especially important that you're in the correct directory before going further. Creating a git repo in a directory where you weren't expecting to be is going to cause <em>a lot</em> of confusion.</p>

<p>Always double-check where you are with the <code>pwd</code> (print working directory) command:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">pwd</span>
/Users/your_computer_username/Desktop/compciv-2016
</code></pre>

<p>The command to create a Git repo in the current folder is simply:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git init
</code></pre>

<p>The result of that command should be something like this (except your name instead of <code>dan</code> of course):</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/dan/Desktop/compciv-2016/.git/
</code></pre>

<p>What that means is that inside <code>~/Desktop/compciv-2016</code>, there is a <em>hidden</em> folder named <code>.git</code>. You will <strong>never</strong> have to open that folder or go inside of it, but that's where the magic happens. That's where the Git software stores all of tracking information and metadata for the target file folder. Delete that <code>.git/</code> subdirectory, and your file folder is no different than it was before.</p>

<h1 id="adding-changes-to-be-tracked-by-git">Adding changes to be tracked by Git</h1>

<p>So how does Git "know" that we've made changes to the file folder, and that it should be keeping track of these changes? We have to <em>tell it specifically</em> – there's no autosave-autotrack as you find in modern Word processing software.</p>

<p>So let's make some changes by adding two new files in our <code>compciv-2016</code> folder:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>test.txt</code></li>
  <li><code>foo.txt</code></li>
</ul>

<p>. You can do this via opening up the <code>~/Desktop/compciv-2016</code> folder in <strong>Sublime Text</strong>.</p>

<p>Or, if you're on OS X/Linux, you can also do this using the <strong>touch</strong> command, which creates empty files (or refreshes their timestamps if they exist):</p>

<p>(assuming you're still in <code>~/Desktop/compciv-2016</code>):</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ touch test.txt 
$ touch foo.txt
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may have other files and folders in <code>compciv-2016</code> at this point. I'll just assume that it's empty except for <code>test.txt</code> and <code>foo.txt</code>. The existence of other files in that folder does not matter, for our current purpose.</p>

<h2 id="the-git-status-command">The <code>git status</code> command</h2>

<p>The <code>git status</code> command tells us what's going on in the current state of the repo, including what changes have been made, which have been "committed", and other details that will become clearer after we've gotten the hang of things.</p>

<p>For now, at this young state of our repository, <code>git status</code> will tell us how simply how empty our repository is, even though files exist. In other words, even though we've created files inside of <code>compciv-2016</code>, it doesn't mean anything to Git until we've explicitly told Git: "Hey, we want to track these files".</p>

<p>So let's see what Git is <em>currently</em> tracking using the <code>git status</code> command:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span class="k">in </span>what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>

  foo.txt
  test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">"git add"</span> to track<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, your <code>compciv-2016</code> folder may have other files. But pretend for now that only <code>foo.txt</code> and <code>test.txt</code> exist. The response from the <strong>git</strong> program (which I'll leave lowercased in subsequent mentions) is that there are two <strong>untracked files</strong>, <code>foo.txt</code> and <code>test.txt</code>, and that we need to use <code>git add</code> to track them.</p>

<h2 id="the-git-add-command">The <code>git add</code> command</h2>

<p>So let's follow that advice and use the <code>git add</code> command to tell git to track the <code>test.txt</code> file. Here's what that looks like:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Executing that command will result in a silent confirmation (unless <code>test.txt</code> doesn't exist). Run <code>git status</code> again to see what's changed:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to unstage<span class="o">)</span>

  new file:   test.txt

Untracked files:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span class="k">in </span>what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>

  foo.txt

</code></pre>

<p>That message is a little hard to parse, but here are the important bits:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>Changes to be committed:
    new file:   test.txt

Untracked files:
    foo.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>foo.txt</code> file remains untracked. But git now knows that <code>test.txt</code> is a "new file" to keep track of.</p>

<h3 id="lets-make-an-error-with-git-add">Let's make an error with <code>git add</code></h3>

<p>Before moving on, let's make a deliberate error with <code>git add</code> by trying to refer to a non-existent file:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add blablbblblabh.TXT
fatal: pathspec <span class="s1">'blablbblblabh.TXT'</span> did not match any files
</code></pre>

<p>No harm done. And it should make intuitive sense: Git can only track files that actually exist in the repository.</p>

<h1 id="committing-changes-with-git">Committing changes with Git</h1>

<p>One of the hardest things to understand about <strong>git</strong> is the difference between the <code>add</code> and <code>commit</code> commands, as in, <em>why are they two different commands</em>?. Well, the <code>add</code> command tells git to note whatever changes have been made to the repository. Think of <code>commit</code> as telling git to take a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the current state of <em>currently tracked files</em> in the repository.</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">"first change"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, it's worth noting that the <code>git commit</code> command is usually run in tandem with a flag: <code>-m</code> – which is short for, "message". In other words, for every commit/snapshot we make, we're required to include a short descriptive message. Keep it simple and short, and keep it enclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p>The result of that <code>git commit</code> command will look something like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>[master (root-commit) 2aae7e8] first change
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Virtually none of that needs to be parsed by you, though some of it should make some kind of sense: a single file has been changed (i.e. <code>test.txt</code> has been added into existence). And <code>first change</code> in the first line reflects the message text that I provided via <code>-m "first change"</code>.</p>

<p>Use <code>git status</code> to see what's changed. As far as git is concerned, <code>test.txt</code> has already been dealt with and <code>foo.txt</code> is still untracked. We'll deal with <code>foo.txt</code> later.</p>

<p>Now, let's focus on "pushing" our changes to Github.</p>

<h1 id="syncing-our-git-repository-with-github">Syncing our git repository with Github</h1>

<p>As I've said earlier, <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> are two different things. Everything we've done so far has been with just <strong>Git</strong> and localized to our own computer, and thus, independent of <strong>Github</strong>.</p>

<p>But now we want to move our <code>compciv-2016</code> repository to the "cloud", and Github is currently one of the most popular services for doing so.</p>

<p>Switch out of your command-line (but don't close it yet) and into your browser. The first steps with Github are no different than signing up and creating things via any web service.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-new-repo-on-githubcom">How to create a new repo on Github.com</h2>

<p>I'm assuming <strong>you've already created an account on Github</strong> and have your own username. For the purposes of demonstration, I've created a Github account with the username of: <strong>some-student</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that the account homepage for <strong>some-student</strong> is at the following URL:</p>

<p><a class="url" href="https://github.com/some-student">https://github.com/some-student</a></p>

<p>Your <em>own</em> account follows the same convention, with your account name instead of <code>some-student</code>, of course.</p>

<p>After you have logged in to Github, you can create a new Github repo by going to this URL: <a class="url" href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a></p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the button-clicky way (keeping in mind that Github's layout could change): Look for the <strong>plus sign</strong> in the <strong>top right</strong> of your Github homepage. Click it to reveal a dropdown menu, then select <strong>New repository</strong>:</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="/files/images/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations/github-dropdown-new-repo.png" /></p>

<h2 id="name-and-create-the-repository">Name and create the repository</h2>

<p>In the <strong>Repository name</strong>, type in the name of our desired repo:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  compciv-2016
</code></pre>

<p>You can ignore the other options for now. Just click the <strong style="color:green">green</strong> button, <strong>Create repository</strong>:</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="/files/images/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations/github-create-repo-compciv-2016" /></p>

<p>Upon creation of the repository, you'll be taken to a screen with suggested steps to "create a new repository on the command line" or "push an existing repository from the command line". We will be doing the <strong>latter</strong> but you don't have to worry about copying the suggested code, as I'll provide the commands and some explanation of them in the next section.</p>

<p>For reference's sake, the URL to your Github repository for <code>compciv-2016</code> should be:</p>

<p><a class="url" href="https://github.com/some-student/compciv-2016">https://github.com/some-student/compciv-2016</a></p>

<p>Visiting it now will reveal that it is empty. That will change after we've completed the syncing process.</p>

<h1 id="syncing-our-local-git-repository-with-the-github-repository">Syncing our local git repository with the Github repository</h1>

<p>At this point, we've created a Git repository in the <code>compciv-2016</code> folder of our computer. We've also created a Git repository of that same name on Github, using Github's web interface.</p>

<p>But we've done <em>nothing</em> to actually connect the two repositories, besides give them the same name. Which literally means nothing to anyone, anywhere. <code>compciv-2016</code> is just a name we made up for two different repositories. And they are physically different in the most obvious ways: for example, our <em>local</em> version of <code>compciv-2016</code> has the file <code>test.txt</code> in it, whereas our Github version of <code>compciv-2016</code> is empty.</p>

<p>We want the Github repository of <code>compciv-2016</code> to be the "canonical" repository, i.e. it contains the "official" state of our repository. However, it is "behind" the Git repository on our own computer, so we will fix that in this section.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-origin-of-your-repository">Setting the "origin" of your repository</h2>

<p>Switch back to your Terminal and to your local <code>compciv-2016</code> repo, e.g. your <code>~/Desktop/compciv-2016</code> folder. Run <code>pwd</code> and <code>git status</code> to make sure you're at the right place.</p>

<p>Then, run this command, which is a command you should only have to run once for the normal lifetime of a project – make sure to replace <code>some-student</code> with your own Github account name</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git remote add origin git@github.com:some-student/compciv-2016.git
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is a command you should only have to run <em>once</em> – unless your computer gets wiped out and you have to re-download/re-create the repository – so I won't bother explaining it in detail. That descriptor, <code>origin</code>, is somewhat notable, in that this <code>git remote</code> command establishes <code>github.com:some-student/compciv-2016.git</code> as the "origin" repository, i.e. the <em>canonical</em> repository.</p>

<p>If the command works, you should get no feedback from the command line. If you get an error, please email me before continuing.</p>

<h2 id="pushing-your-changes-to-the-origin">Pushing your changes to the origin</h2>

<p>Now is the time to <strong>push</strong> the changes that we made in our local repository, i.e. the addition and committing of <code>test.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The command for that is <code>git push</code>; however, with this being our very first "push" from local repository to the "origin" repository on Github, we have to add a couple of parameters this one time only:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you'll probably be prompted for your Github username and password, because you are effectively making changes to the content hosted by Github under your account. Again, type in your <strong>Github username and password</strong> (not your computer username and password).</p>

<p>And provided everything is correctly set up, <strong>git</strong> will describe what was pushed and how long it took – mostly details that you can ignore:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 206 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:some-student/compciv-2016.git
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin by rebasing.
</code></pre>

<p>Go to the homepage for your <strong>Github repository</strong>, e.g. the URL below, except with your Github username instead of <code>some-student</code>:</p>

<p><a class="url" href="https://github.com/some-student/compciv-2016">https://github.com/some-student/compciv-2016</a></p>

<p>It should look something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="image" class="bordered" src="/files/images/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations/github-check-the-pushes.png" /></p>

<p>Take special note of <code>test.txt</code> and the commit message (<code>first change</code>).</p>

<p>Congrats, you've created a Git repository and synced it online with Github!</p>

<h1 id="making-more-additions-and-changes-to-our-synced-repo">Making more additions and changes to our synced repo</h1>

<p>Now that we've turned our <code>compciv-2016</code> folder into a Git repository, then created a synced copy on Github, let's review the whole <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>push</code> cycle.</p>

<p>Get back to your command-line prompt and into your <code>compciv-2016</code> folder. If you've done what I've done so far, type <code>git status</code>:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

  foo.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember ol' <code>foo.txt</code>? We never officially added it to the repository. Let's do that now:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add foo.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>git status</code> again if you're unsure of what the result is.</p>

<p>Now, let's <em>commit</em> this change, with whatever <em>message</em> you please:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">"foo is fun"</span>
<span class="o">[</span>master 5bc4217] foo is fun
 1 file changed, 0 insertions<span class="o">(</span>+<span class="o">)</span>, 0 deletions<span class="o">(</span>-<span class="o">)</span>
 create mode 100644 foo.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Again, run <code>git status</code> to see what's changed.</p>

<p>And now, <strong>push</strong> it to Github. This time, you should only have to type <code>git push</code>; you shouldn't have to include <code>-u origin master</code> – however, you probably will have to re-enter your Github username and password:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git push
Counting objects: 2, <span class="k">done</span>.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% <span class="o">(</span>2/2<span class="o">)</span>, <span class="k">done</span>.
Writing objects: 100% <span class="o">(</span>2/2<span class="o">)</span>, 232 bytes | 0 bytes/s, <span class="k">done</span>.

To git@github.com:some-student/compciv-2016.git
   2aae7e8..5bc4217  master -&gt; master
</code></pre>

<p>Now, jump back to the Github page for your repository, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/some-student/compciv-2016">https://github.com/some-student/compciv-2016</a>, to see the change:</p>

<p><img alt="image" class="bordered" src="/files/images/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations/github-check-the-pushes-2.png" /></p>

<h2 id="add-commit-push-again-now-with-folders">Add-commit-push-again: Now with folders</h2>

<p>OK, let's repeat the process. But first, let's make some new changes to track:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add a bunch of text to <code>test.txt</code> and <strong>Save</strong> the file (via Sublime Text), e.g.:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  hello
  world
  blahblah
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new sub-directory named <code>foobar/</code>, i.e. <code>compciv-2016/foobar</code></li>
  <li>Inside <code>foobar/</code>, create a new file named <code>xyz</code>, i.e. <code>compciv-2016/foobar/xyz</code> – you can leave it empty</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, your <code>compciv-2016</code> may have more files/folders, but at the minimum, it should look like this:</p>

<p><img alt="image" class="bordered" src="/files/images/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations/sublime-text-foo-blah.png" /></p>

<p>Now run <code>git status</code>:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   test.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

  foobar/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre>

<p>Note the two divisions of changes: the first section are currently-tracked files that have been <em>modified</em>. The bottom section lists non-tracked files/folders (it doesn't bother listing <code>foobar/xyz</code> since <code>foobar/</code> is untracked).</p>

<p>Let's add the <code>foobar</code> folder then commit it:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git add foobar
$ git commit -m 'a fun new folder'
</code></pre>

<p><em>Before</em> you push it, visit the Github repo webpage and see what it looks like. Does the <code>foobar/</code> folder appear? Did you expect it to?</p>

<p>The answer to both of those questions should be <em>No</em>. Without a <strong>push</strong> command, our <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands aren't <em>known</em> by the Github-hosted repo. To be honest, you'll be doing <code>add/commit/push</code> in such quick succession for most of your changes that this distinction probably won't matter much, practically speaking. But it's worth noting, again, that <strong>git</strong> is <em>not</em> <strong>Github</strong> – and the two do not talk to each other until we explicitly make it so.</p>

<p>(You'll obviously want to be aware of this if you ever use Git and Github in a professional/team environment)</p>

<p>OK, so let's sync up the repos with a <code>git push</code>:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git push
</code></pre>

<p>I'll spare you the resulting output. Here's what my Github repo looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="image" class="bordered" src="/files/images/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations/sublime-text-foo-blah-3.png" /></p>

<p>Even though we made changes to <code>test.txt</code> (i.e. added a few lines of text to it), they weren't pushed because we never <em>added</em> them. Git does not assume that every change you make – such as editing/adding/removing files – are changes that you want to <em>commit</em> to.</p>

<p>Let's change that – again, use <code>git status</code> between <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>. and <code>push</code> to see details of what's going on – but as you get comfortable, the <code>add/commit/push</code> sequence becomes routine:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add test.txt
<span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s1">'some more changes'</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git push
</code></pre>

<h3 id="deletions-are-additions-too">Deletions are additions too</h3>

<p>The command <code>git add</code> makes it seem that it just handles the occasions when files are <em>added</em> to a file folder. However, <code>git add</code> does not track <em>additions, necessarily; it tracks (i.e. _adds</em>) any kind of change to a repository, including when files are <em>removed</em>.</p>

<p>Delete <code>foo.txt</code> and the <code>foobar/</code> subdirectory from the <code>compciv-2016</code> repository. You can do this the "old-fashioned" way by going into your graphical operating system and dragging those files into the "Trash" or "Recycle Bin".</p>

<p>Then return to your local <code>compciv-2016</code> repository via the command-line and run <code>git status</code>:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

  deleted:    foo.txt
  deleted:    foobar/xyz

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre>

<p>Deletions are just like any other <em>change</em> to the repository. You can add these changes as if they were like any other (note that <strong>Tab</strong> autocomplete won't work):</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git add foo.txt
$ git add foobar/xyz
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> as before:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git commit -m 'bye bye files'
$ git push
</code></pre>

<h2 id="seeing-the-log-of-our-changes">Seeing the log of our changes</h2>

<p>So we've done all these <code>git add/commit/push</code> commands – but where is the evidence that it's actually tracking each change? Hopefully, you won't run into a situation (at least, early on) in which you need to <strong>revert</strong> to a previous commit. But to see the commits (i.e. the <strong>snapshots</strong>) you've made so far, you can run the <code>git log</code> command, which will list each commit in reverse chronological order:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git log

    first change
</code></pre>

<h1 id="setting-up-gitignore">Setting up <code>.gitignore</code></h1>

<p>Before moving on to the next section on "conveniences", let's set up a <code>.gitignore</code> file. The <code>.gitignore</code> file is a hidden text file that, by convention, lists the kinds of files that we <em>don't</em> want to include in our Git repositories (either offline or online on Github). Think of it as a blacklist to prevent unwanted files from being part of the repository history, either common junk files or very sensitive files, i.e. files that contain passwords.</p>

<p>In Sublime Text, create the <code>.gitignore</code> file in the <code>compciv-2016</code> folder. In other words, if your <code>compciv-2016</code> folder is inside <code>~/Desktop</code>, the full path to it would be:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    ~/Desktop/compciv-2016/.gitignore
</code></pre>

<p>(<strong>Do not</strong> mess up the spelling!)</p>

<p>Then add the following lines (it's OK to copy and paste them) and save the file:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>.DS_Store
creds_*
tempdata/
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, add/commit/push:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add .gitignore
<span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s1">'adding gitignore'</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git push
</code></pre>

<p>Throughout the homework and projects for this class, we'll be making use of files that begin with <code>creds_</code> to store passwords. These should <em>never</em> be tracked by the Git repository – otherwise, they would get pushed onto the online Github repository. And remember – Github is <strong>online</strong>. That's what makes it convenient to use. But very dangerous when dealing with sensitive data.</p>

<p>Subsequent homework assignments will have you creating files that begin with <code>creds_</code> and also, downloading data files into <code>tempdata/</code>. This <code>.gitignore</code> file will keep those files from accidentally being pushed online.</p>

<p>Note: If you do accidentally commit and push something online that you didn't want to push online, please email me immediately, and I can walk you through the steps. As you can imagine, the history-tracking conveniences that Git provide also mean that <em>deleting</em> history from a repository is more complicated than just deleting files.</p>

<p>After committing/pushing that <code>.gitignore</code> file, test it by creating a new empty file named <code>creds_twitter_password</code>.</p>

<p>Then run <code>git status</code> – if your <code>.gitignore</code> file was written correctly, <code>creds_twitter_password.txt</code> should not show up anywhere on <code>git status</code> – the <strong>git</strong> software should know to <em>never</em> track it for any purpose, at this point.</p>

<p>To drive home the point, create a file named: <code>credstwitterpassword.txt</code>. Running <code>git status</code> <em>should</em> list <code>credstwitterpassword.txt</code> as an untracked file, because the pattern in <code>.gitignore</code> is for <code>creds_*</code> – i.e. files that begin <em>exactly</em> as <code>creds_</code>, which <code>credstwitter...</code> does <em>not</em>.</p>

<h1 id="smoothing-out-the-workflow">Smoothing out the workflow</h1>

<p>Now that we've gotten the basic cycle of git operations down, let's add a few conveniences.</p>

<h2 id="using-the---all-option-for-git-add">Using the <code>--all</code> option for <code>git add</code></h2>

<p>We don't have to <code>git add</code> files one-by-one, we can add all changes with the <code>--all</code> flag:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git add --all
</code></pre>

<p>I use this 99% of the time, but you may want to be careful for your first several dozen add/commit/push cycles. That is, run <code>git status</code> to make sure you won't be adding anything to the repo that you <em>don't</em> want to actually add.</p>

<p>Here's out to test out this command in action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add two subdirectories, <code>apples/</code> and <code>oranges/</code></li>
  <li>Add a bunch of random files in those directories, e.g. <code>apples/hello.txt</code> and <code>oranges/world.txt</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of adding them one-by-one, you can add them all with <code>git add --all</code> – then <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> as before:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add --all
<span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">"a bunch of apples and oranges"</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git push
</code></pre>

<p>This applies to changes that are deletions, of course: delete all those unnecessary files, then add, commit, and push the changes:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git add --all
<span class="gp">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s1">'whatev'</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git push
</code></pre>

<h2 id="automatically-authenticating-yourself-with-github">Automatically authenticating yourself with Github</h2>

<p>Do you find it annoying to retype your username and password with each push to Github? You <em>should</em> – pushing to Github should feel as natural as saving a file in any other workflow. having to re-authenticate yourself means you'll either be pushing much less frequently than you should. Or even worse: you'll choose a simple password that is easy to crack.</p>

<p>Follow Github's instructions on how to cache/save your Github credentials in your local <strong>Git</strong> configuration – it has separate instructions for each operating system: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/">Caching your GitHub password in Git</a></p>

<p>If you're successful, <code>git push</code> should work automatically without prompting you for your username or password.</p>
