# Demystifying Programming (DP)

> What is this all about?

#### Demystifying programming is a student-led mini-course that seeks to demystify programming through 4 bootcamp-style classes from 10:00 am-1:00 pm EST on Fridays. 

Building on a high-level understanding of the end-to-end software development cycle ([session #1](/session1/session1.md)), the course will provide you with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience traversing through the software development cycle as you develop and launch a functional website powered by Python web-end and hosted on AWS ([session #2](/session2/session2.md), [session #3](/session3/session3.md), and [session #4](/session4/session4.md) ). 

> What materials can students find on this website?

For each of the 4 sessions, this website provides you with: 
* An overview of the material that will be covered
* Setup guides to ensure that you have all the right tools installed
* Mini-tutorials that allow you to familiarize yourself with the concepts covered ahead of time
* Optional materials if you want to engage further
